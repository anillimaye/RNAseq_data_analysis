# RNAseq_data_analysis

This repository will contain the codes that I have been using for performing RNAseq data analysis. The codes have been customized to analyze my RNAseq data. Several resources and videos have helped me to understand the process and what is contained in the repository is probably not the best way to analyze data. But it works. At least it will help beginners.
